This is a prototype for a gaming website idea that I've had for a while. Right now, the goals are:

* allow users to easily create gaming tournaments, supporting both individual-play and team-play
* users can create gaming groups and teams that are intended to replace club/team/community gaming sites in their current form, and so they will need evented calendars, blogs and twitter/youtube integration
